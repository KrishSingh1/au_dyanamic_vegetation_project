Co-located site. FLORA 3 Mulga Tussock survey site(August 2012,May2013,May2014)
Long since fire- 10 - 20 yr. plus, only one old burnt stump of 20cm. Evidence of grazing esp. Rhagodia camel prints old goat droppings or donkey (3cm diam. plate shaped). Prints of dingos, cats and foxes. Digging of either varanidae or bandicoot. Square kangaroo droppings, somewhat atypical. Bull ants present. Yellow abdomen ants. Predatory black beetles. Sphecid wasps. Katydid. Speckled black and orange grasshoppers. Eragrostis largely harvested by ants, post fall, and drying off.","NA","NA",NA,53569,"2014-05-15T09:00:00","2014-05-15T09:00:00","Plot had not been burnt for quite some years.

DEAD - WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LARGE ACACIA RETICULATE ON SOUTH TRANSECT 5 THERE WERE NO SHRUBS THAT WERE DEAD; THAT IS ONLY SMALL PARTS OF ALL SHRUBS WERE DEAD' AND IT IS DEAD PARTS THAT APPEAR ON INTERCEPTS AS DEAD. 

Dead Triodia of 0.01m usually reflects the dead bases that still reflect a collapsed ring. 

Triodia heights are to the top of live hummock leaves only, and do not include the inflorescence. Tussock grass heights include the flowering spike. Same for 0002 & 0003. 

15th May rain overnight from 14th so transects 7 to 10 the tussock grasses are a little shorter due to weight of water. Overcast, steady drizzle overnight. 

There are parallels here to drought death (+/- senescence) of Grevilleas at Boorabbin sandplain, WAT, sites. Many mature Grevillea pinnatifid plants were dead outside the plot. 

There was heavy grazing of Rhagodia 005316 and 005335; the former was cut severely to thick hard wood. 

 With Triodia seedlings at ~10 leaf stage and resprouting bases not yet merged. Aluta seedlings were only small 3-5cm; and in patchy clusters of 5-15 plants. There were significant bare areas. Only the very NW corner on the dune lower slope was unburnt; this appeared to be the case for the dune in general including the fauna pit-line to the southwest of the plot's southwest corner. Western Desert NTS maps indicated the most recent fire was in 2012. Cover will change as Triodia and shrubs increase in bulk.

Surface strew is very dense across 70% of the site that is not vegetated or a depression, forming a gibber pavement of ironstone (?) and some quartzite. Strew size is gravel, with very small number of rocks >0.1m. 20% of surface is puffy clay, or cracking clay in the gilgais. Introduced plant numbers are low, with Malvastrum americanum recorded. Grazing impacts throughout site, with most grass species grazed, and modification of Rhagodia spinescens and some Maireana aphylla. Pugging across site, and kangaroo dung in some gilgais.

Site is generally flat with a slight (1) slope towards the South-West corner with some undulation throughout the site including drainage depressions that hold some water during the dry season. 
 
No surface strew or outcrop on the plot.
 
 
Site has been control burned this dry-season with a patchy mosaic of burned and unburned grass clusters. There is some regeneration of grasses but not as much as other burned sites in the region. 
 
Grazing evident by Agile Wallabies and Kangaroos but no evidence of cattle pressure. Effect of introduced plants seems negligible, possible due to recent fire. A lot of Passiflora, Bidens spinosa and Cenchrus ciliaris on the last visit. Some Cucumis and Stylosanthes species present this visit.
 
 
Community continues 100m from the centre of the plot in all directions. The nearest infrastructure is the walking trail 30m North of the Northern edge.

Plot is on a plain- 200m from base of Devonian reef. 2 degree slope to the south east increasing slightly to the north east corner. Minimal surface strew- black soil but some patches of limestone gravels. Homogeneity- south east corner is 10m in from rarely used fire track. 300m to the south and 100m to the west is the same community. Long unburnt- no scarring on Bauhinia and grasses very dense. Grazing effect is low but some old cattle scats through the site. Introduced plant effect is low to moderate- Passiflora foetida in some denser patches on northern edge.

Site topography largely unchanged since the last visit. A 1-2 slope to the North coming off the base of a dune and into a broad swale.

Impact of introduced plant species is minimal and there is no evidence of grazing.
