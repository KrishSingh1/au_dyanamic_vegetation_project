Previously burnt in a control burn (2016/17), but remains unburnt in the most recent fires. There are many more species in the regrowth, which were not collected the first time.
The physical description hasn’t changed.
The site is Eucalyptus pauciflora open woodland, with Eucalyptus viminalis scattered through the site. The mid-story is quite sparse with some regrowth of the Eucalypts and the Red-stemmed shrub, and the ground layer is very diverse with lots of forbs and Poa labillardierei.
The site is wet, there have been decent rains in the past few days so the soil is still damp. The vegetation response is fruiting and flowering. There are fruit on the Eucalyptus pauciflora, and many of the forbs are flowering, Lomandra has fruit and the Poa species have seed heads.
More introduced species recorded on this visit. There is Black thistle scattered throughout the site, as well as a few weedy forbs.
Grazing in the site is low, but evidence of kangaroos throughout the site.

The landform element is a hill slope with a pattern of mountains. The plot has a slope to the south at 5 degrees even throughout the site. A lot of surface strew visible in the site due to fire burning off the grasses. A lot of basalt gravel and cobbles and some larger boulder possible shale or outcrop. VERY recently burnt, 8 weeks ago Feb 2018. Most of the upper canopy is still alive but most of the younger snow gum have died or have been scorched and are reshooting. The majority of the lower stratum has been burnt with some small patches of grasses unburnt. Minimal grazing impact by pigs and roos. Introduced plant species impact is low, some Scotch thistle is present but other introduced plants may have been burnt out. Community is confined to plot. 30m from Western edge of plot is track to Governors lookout where fire has stopped.
