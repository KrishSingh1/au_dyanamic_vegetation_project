Some gravel- more where the track comes through. Some sandstone outcrops. Minimal grazing. Has been burnt- scarring even on younger trees to moderate height. Introduced plant species effect is low- some weedy grasses on edge of track. Homogeneity- track runs south to north from the 10m mark on the southern edge veering north west and existing the plot at the 90m mark on the western boundary. Vegetation community is contained because of this. Minimal impact of introduced plant species - Hypochaeris radicata present.
