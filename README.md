# The Code and Data Repository for my MRes Project

Please see **Essential Scripts** for the essential code used in the project

Please see **Datasets** for datasets used in the project. However, a separate repository will be set up for large datafiles, such as extracted SLGA's soil properties and DEM-derived data.
